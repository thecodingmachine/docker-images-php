### Version 3

### Initial

#### Important changes

v2 images are based on a Debian Stretch. v3 images are based on Ubuntu 18.04.
Interally, v3 images are built from the Ondrej PPA. This is a radical change from v2 that was built from the official PHP Docker image. As a result, the v3 image do not have PECL installed, nor a build environment. This makes the v3 images ~200MB lighter.

#### Changes in extensions

The following extensions are now enabled by default: calendar exif pcntl shmop sockets sysvmsg sysvsem sysvshm wddx zip
The sqlite3 extension was previously enabled by default, but must now be enabled manually

### Version 2

### Initial

#### New features

- thecodingmachine/php image now has a "slim" variant that does not contain any extension but that can be used
  to [build the extensions very easily](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/docker-images-php/blob/dfdaa984f0fcc3d66a1b9fef5a6643582deb4d0d/README.md#compiling-extensions-in-the-slim-image).

#### Breaking changes

- PHP 7.1 base image is now **Debian Stretch**
- Dropped Node 6 images

#### New extensions

#### Organization

The project layout has been deeply changed. There is now only one branch for all the PHP versions.
Each extension now has its own installation script in the `/extensions/core` directory with symlinks for the 
extensions in the `/extensions/7.1` and `/extensions/7.2` directory based on the targeted PHP version.
